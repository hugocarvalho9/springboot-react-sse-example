# springboot-react-sse-example
A simple full-stack app using Spring Boot, React, and Server-Sent Events (SSE). The Spring Boot backend streams real-time data using WebFlux, and the React frontend receives and displays these updates in a list. This project demonstrates how to implement real-time notifications in a modern web app using SSE.
